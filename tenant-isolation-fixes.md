# Multi-Tenant Isolation Security Fixes

## Critical Issue Identified
The SaaS product had a major security vulnerability where tenant users could see data from other tenants after login. This is a critical breach in multi-tenant architecture.

## Root Cause
Most API routes were missing proper tenant isolation middleware, allowing users to access data across tenant boundaries.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Products Route (api/routes/products.js) - ✅ FIXED
- Added `extractTenant`, `validateTenantAccess`, `autoTenantFilter` middleware to ALL routes
- Fixed GET all products, GET single product, POST create, PUT update, DELETE routes
- Added tenant filtering to all database queries
- Super admin bypass implemented for cross-tenant access

### 2. Customers Route (api/routes/customers.js) - ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED
- Added tenant middleware to GET all customers and GET single customer
- Added tenant middleware to POST create customer
- **STILL NEEDS FIXING:**
  - PUT update customer route
  - DELETE customer route
  - POST add note route
  - PUT assign customer route
  - PUT loyalty points route
  - GET stats route

### 3. Routes Still Needing Complete Tenant Isolation
- api/routes/suppliers.js
- api/routes/inventory.js
- api/routes/orders.js
- api/routes/categories.js
- api/routes/billing.js
- api/routes/warehouses.js
- api/routes/users.js (tenant user management)

## Pattern for Fixing Routes

### For GET routes (list/single):
```javascript
router.get('/', [
  protect,
  extractTenant,
  validateTenantAccess,
  autoTenantFilter,
  // other middleware...
], async (req, res) => {
  // Use req.tenantFilter in queries
  let query = req.tenantFilter || {};
  // ... rest of logic
});
```

### For individual resource routes (GET by ID, PUT, DELETE):
```javascript
router.get('/:id', [
  protect,
  extractTenant,
  validateTenantAccess,
  // other middleware...
], async (req, res) => {
  const query = { 
    _id: req.params.id,
    ...(req.user.role !== 'super_admin' ? { tenantId: req.tenant.id } : {})
  };
  // Use query in findOne/findOneAndUpdate
});
```

### For CREATE routes:
```javascript
router.post('/', [
  protect,
  extractTenant,
  validateTenantAccess,
  autoTenantFilter,
  // other middleware...
], async (req, res) => {
  // autoTenantFilter automatically adds tenantId to req.body
  const data = { ...req.body, createdBy: req.user.id };
  // ... create logic
});
```

## Immediate Action Required
The customer routes and all other data routes need immediate tenant isolation fixes to prevent data leakage between tenants.

## Testing Required
After fixes:
1. Create two test companies (001, 002)
2. Create users in each company
3. Login as user from company 001
4. Verify they can ONLY see data from company 001
5. Repeat for company 002

## Security Impact
- **CRITICAL**: Without these fixes, tenant data is completely exposed across companies
- **GDPR/Privacy**: Major compliance violation
- **Business Impact**: Complete loss of data isolation in SaaS product
